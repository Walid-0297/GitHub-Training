# Constructors 🧱

This mini project demonstrates the use of **constructors** in C#, including:

- Default constructor
- Overloaded constructors (with one or two parameters)
- Using default values if the user does not input valid data

---

## 💡 Concepts Covered

- Constructor overloading
- Input validation
- Default values
- Object initialization

---

## 📌 Project Summary

The user is asked to input a name and age. Based on what is entered:
- If both are valid → uses full constructor.
- If only name is valid → uses constructor with name.
- If only age is valid → uses constructor with age.
- If both are missing or invalid → uses default constructor with default values.

---

## 🔁 Sample Inputs

```bash
Enter your name (or press Enter to use default): 
Enter your age (or press Enter to use default): 30

→ Output: Name: Unknown, Age: 30
