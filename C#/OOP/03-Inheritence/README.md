# Inheritance Demo

This project demonstrates the concept of **Inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming using C#.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Base class and derived classes
- Constructor chaining using `: base(...)`
- Method overriding using `virtual` and `override`

---

## Project Description

We define a base class called `Animal` that includes common properties and behaviors (like `Name` and `Speak()`).

Then, we create two child classes:
- `Dog` : inherits from `Animal` and adds its own property (`Breed`) and overrides `Speak()`
- `Cat` : inherits from `Animal`, adds `Breed`, and overrides `Speak()`
