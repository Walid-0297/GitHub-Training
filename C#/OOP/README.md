# C# OOP Projects 

This repository contains C# projects designed to apply and reinforce **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It is a continuation of the C# Fundamentals phase, focusing on real-world modeling using classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces, and more.

##  Project List

###  Individual Concept Mini Tasks

These small tasks help reinforce isolated OOP topics in practice:

- **Properties + Encapsulation**
  - Input & validate name/age of a person.
  - Demonstrates property usage and private fields.

- **Constructors**
  - Create objects with overloaded constructors and default values.

- **Inheritance**
  - Demonstrate parent-child relationships with base/derived classes.

- **Polymorphism**
  - Override methods and use base class references to demonstrate dynamic behavior.

- **Interfaces**
  - Implement interface behavior across multiple classes.

###  Basic OOP Concept-Based Projects

#### 1. Student Management System
- **Concepts Covered**: Classes, Properties, Constructors, Lists.
- **Description**: A `Student` class stores student details like name and ID. We manage a list of students and display their info.

#### 2. Employee Management System
- **Concepts Covered**: Inheritance, Overriding, Encapsulation.
- **Description**: A base `Employee` class with derived classes `Manager` and `Developer`. Methods are overridden to show behavior per role.

#### 3. Vehicle Management System
- **Concepts Covered**: Abstraction, Interfaces, Polymorphism.
- **Description**: Interface `IVehicle` with methods like `StartEngine()` and `StopEngine()`. Implemented by classes like `Car` and `Bike`.

###  Full Practice Projects (From Video Series)

These are larger practical projects combining multiple OOP principles.

#### 1.  Library Management System
- Manage book borrowing and returning using classes, lists, and object tracking.

#### 2.  Maze Game
- A simple text-based maze game built with classes, inheritance, and decision logic.

#### 3.  Text Data Analyzer
- Analyze lines, words, and characters from text files using OOP design.

##  Goal

These projects provide a hands-on way to master C# OOP. They are ideal for solidifying knowledge before diving into full .NET applications, freelancing, or job opportunities.
