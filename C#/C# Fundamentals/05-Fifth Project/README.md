A basic ATM simulation with PIN verification, balance check, withdrawal, and deposit options.

### Features

- PIN-based access control
- Display current balance
- Withdraw and deposit money

### Concepts Used

- `while` loop for continuous menu
- `if-else` for decision-making
- Numeric operations for balance management

### How It Works

1. User enters a correct PIN to access the ATM.
2. Displays a menu:
