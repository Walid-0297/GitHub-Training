# Text Menu App (Console Version)

A simple console application that displays a text-based menu, allows user interaction, and responds to user choices.

## Features

- Text menu with multiple options
- Loop until the user chooses to exit
- Uses switch-case for clean branching logic
- Shows greeting, current date, or a random number based on user input

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Console Application
- `while` loop
- `switch-case` control structure
- `DateTime` and `Random` built-in classes

## How It Works

1. The app starts and displays a menu.
2. The user is asked to choose between 4 options:
   - Say Hello
   - Show Current Date
   - Show a Random Number
   - Exit the Program
3. The app processes the input using a `switch` statement.
4. The menu repeats until the user selects Exit.
