# C# Fundamentals Projects 

This repository contains beginner-level C# projects built using **fundamentals only** — without Object-Oriented Programming. These projects are ideal for those who are just starting with C# and want to strengthen their knowledge in variables, conditions, loops, arrays, methods, and basic file handling.
