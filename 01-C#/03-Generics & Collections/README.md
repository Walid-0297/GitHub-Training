# Generics & Collections Projects

This folder contains practice projects to master **Generics** and **Collections** in C#.  
Each project focuses on using generic collections like `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `Queue<T>`, and `Stack<T>` along with generic classes and methods.

##  Project List

### 1. Student Grades Manager
- **Concepts Covered:** `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `List<T>`, loops, basic methods.
- **Description:**  
  A system to store students and their grades.  
  - Add new students.  
  - Add grades for each student.  
  - Calculate and display the average for each student.

### 2. Inventory Management System
- **Concepts Covered:** `List<T>`, searching, filtering, and optional generic classes.
- **Description:**  
  Manage a collection of products with features:  
  - Add and remove products.  
  - Search products by ID or name.  
  - Calculate total stock or value.

### 3. Task Scheduler (Queue-based)
- **Concepts Covered:** `Queue<T>`, enqueue/dequeue, iteration.
- **Description:**  
  A simple scheduler to manage tasks:  
  - Add tasks in order.  
  - Process tasks in FIFO order.  
  - Display remaining tasks.

##  **Goal**
These projects will strengthen your understanding of:
- Working with **generic collections** in C#.
- Designing classes and methods to integrate with collections.
- Managing and iterating data effectively.

By completing these three projects, you will build a solid foundation in **Generics & Collections**, preparing you for more advanced topics and real-world scenarios.
