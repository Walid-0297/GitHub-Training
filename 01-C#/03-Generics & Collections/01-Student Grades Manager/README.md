# Student Grades Manager

A console application to manage students and their grades using **C# Generics and Collections**.

## Features
- Add a new student.
- Add grades for each student.
- Display all students and their grades.
- Calculate and display the average grade for each student.

## Concepts Covered
- `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` to store student names and their grades.
- `List<T>` to store multiple grades for each student.
- Input validation using `int.TryParse`.
- Iterating collections with `foreach`.

## How It Works
1. The app runs in a loop showing a menu of options.
2. Each option is handled using a `switch` statement.
3. Grades are dynamically stored and managed using generic collections.

## Future Improvements
- Save and load data from a file.
- Add option to remove a student or specific grade.
- Advanced reporting features.

**Goal:** This project helps practice **Generics** (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`) and fundamental C# collection manipulation.
