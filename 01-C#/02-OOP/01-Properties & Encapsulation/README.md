#  Properties & Encapsulation

This is a simple C# console project demonstrating the concepts of **Properties** and **Encapsulation**, two fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

##  Topics Covered

- `private` fields and encapsulation  
- `public` properties with `get` and `set` accessors  
- Input validation using loops and conditions  
- Basic use of classes and objects  

---

##  Project Description

The application asks the user to:

1. Enter their **name**, which must not be empty or just whitespace.  
2. Enter their **age**, which must be a valid positive number.  

After validation, the app displays the name and age using properties to access the private fields in the `Person` class.

##  Key Learnings

- **Encapsulation** hides the internal state of the `Person` class using private fields (`_name`, `_age`) and only allows access through properties.
- **Properties** provide controlled access to the data:
