# Employee Management System

This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts including **Inheritance**, **Overriding**, and **Encapsulation**.

---

##  Concepts Covered

- **Base and Derived Classes**: The `Employee` class is a base class, inherited by `Manager` and `Developer`.
- **Encapsulation**: Properties are used to encapsulate the fields.
- **Polymorphism (Overriding)**: The `DisplayInfo()` method is overridden in both `Manager` and `Developer` classes.

---

##  Description

- The program defines a base class `Employee` with basic properties: `Name`, `ID`, and `Salary`.
- Two subclasses `Manager` and `Developer` inherit from `Employee`.
- Each subclass adds additional fields (`TeamSize`, `ProgrammingLanguage`) and overrides the `DisplayInfo()` method to show role-specific details.
- A list of employees is created, containing both managers and developers, and their information is displayed using polymorphism.
