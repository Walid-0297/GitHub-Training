# Interface Demo

This project demonstrates how to use interfaces in C# to define a common contract that multiple classes implement.

## Concepts Covered

- Interfaces
- Implementation of interfaces in multiple classes
- Polymorphism with interfaces
- Abstraction

## Description

We define an interface `IShape` that contains two method signatures: `CalculateArea()` and `Draw()`. Two classes (`Rectangle` and `Circle`) implement this interface.

In the `Main()` method, we create objects of both classes and call their methods using the interface type. This demonstrates how interfaces help achieve **polymorphism** and **abstraction** in C#.
